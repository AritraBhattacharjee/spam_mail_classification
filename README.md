# Spam Email Classification Using Machine Learning Algorithm

## Description
<!-- <span style="color:red;"></span> -->
&emsp; This is a Machine Learning Project that uses various Machine Learning Algorithm to classify an email to be an Spam Email or Non-Spam (Ham) Email. 
I have used many classification algorithm( Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms) like Logistic Regression, Logistic Regression with Cross Validation, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classifier, Extra Tree Classifier.

## Future Plan 
&emsp; <!-- 4 tab spaces -->
I am planing to use flask or streamlit to deploy the app, such that any one on the web can use the platform. Another idea is scrap my gmail data using gmail API and manipulate the incomping emails.

## Dataset
&emsp; Dataset is downloaded from kaggle
